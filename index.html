    <h2 class="title">On FreeBSD OCI Containers</h2>
    <div class="date">September 16, 2021</div>

    <p>
      FreeBSD pioneered system-level virtualization by introducing Jails in 2000. Twenty-one years later, containers play a major role in the industry. Every major cloud provider offers services that allow containerized workloads to be run on demand. Containers can be shared through online registries and can be created with convenient DSLs. All of these conveniences have made them the number one choice in today's software development cycle. Can FreeBSD make use of the emerged toolkit? <a href="./posts/2021-09-16-FreeBSD-OCI-jails.html">Read more...</a>

      Tests that affect networking subsystem are destined to be error-prone. Network stack acts as a shared environment, so tests can't really run in parallel. God forbid if you tickle the firewall rules and the test fails to restore the original state. You end up frustrated and cut-out of the internet. Does this all sound familiar? <a href="./posts/2021-03-08-jailed-tests.html">Read more...</a>

    <h2 class="title">Emacs wishes for 2018</h2>
    <div class="date">December 27, 2017</div>

    <p>
      I like making New Year wishes. In 2018 I would like to do so many things, like finally learning Agda, finishing TAPL, reading a dozen of books on Medieval history. But most importantly I would like to improve my workflow by turning Emacs into platform-agnostic ultimate OS. Here's what I'd do. <a href="./posts/2017-12-27-emacs-wishes-2018.html">Read more...</a>
